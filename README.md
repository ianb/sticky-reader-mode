# Sticky Reader Mode

A browser extension that adds a preference to Reader Mode pages, which will default to using Reader Mode on that site.

Note: usually homepages won't be considered an "article" and so they won't default to Reader Mode.

## Installation

To test it out:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Or to install it locally:

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm build
```

Then install `addon/` as a Temporary Extension using `about:debugging`
